Books are written in a specific {BK_LANGUAGES_LINK} and are associated with a skill. Your ability to understand the language will determine how quickly you can read the book. You can acquire a copy of Dictionarium Calradium to be able to read any book, although in very slow manner. Books can be either Skill books or Focus books, mostly the latter. Skill books provide a big amount of experience in their associated skill. Focus books provide less skill, but provide a focus point in that skill.

Therefore, lifestyles are a long-term investment that provides unique benefits that benefit a given role, such as being a mercenary, or a trading caravaneer.

Decisions range from actions that affect only the character themselves, such as buying a book, to affecting their family, such as assuming a culture, to ultimately affecting the continent, such as founding an empire. Decisions can be found inside the Character tab. Each decision has a set of requirements to be completed, which are listed on hovering over each decision.

Moreover, government types define what kind of {BK_SUCCESSIONS_LINK} a realm can practice.{newline}{newline}Governments can be changed through a Decision.

	        link_id="BK_KINGDOM_SUCCESSION_LINK"
	        text="{=!}Kingdom successions may take 2 forms: Elective or Hereditary. How this happens is entirely dictated by the law of {BK_SUCCESSIONS_LINK} taking effect in the kingdom's de jure title (see top of Demesne Hierarchy).{newline}{newline}Hereditary successions are simple: no election takes place. This means that the succession line (shown in Kingdom -> Demesne tab) is definitive. Once the ruler dies, the Heir in the succession line takes their place.{newline}{newline}Elective successions are more complex. The succession line (shown in Kingdom -> Demesne tab) is NOT definitive. Instead, it is a prediction, based on the competence of each candidate as heir. However, once the election takes place, other factors play their part. While the succession scores defines the base competence of a succession candidate, each voting lord will differ in opinion, based on universal criteria: religion, culture, relationship and political agreement. Naturally, a lord won't vote for a candidate whose religion they find evil, who differs in culture and who they hate, no matter how good of a candidate they are.{newline}{newline}Once the succession process is finished, the de jure title of the realm is inherited by the new ruler. If the ruler is chosen from the family of the previous ruler, and they were not expected to become clan leader, they will assume that position. For example, say the second son of the previous ruler was chosen, but the clan was to be inherited by the firstborn son. The second son will now lead both the clan and the realm." />

The only exception to this are sovereign titles, that is, titles directly associated with the rulership of a faction, which are instead passed on by {BK_SUCCESSIONS_LINK}. The inheritance law determines who inside the clan stands to become its next leader and have authority over its properties. Very important to the inheritance are also the {BK_GENDERS_LINK}. While Inheritance determines what makes a candidate better to become leader (ie, Age), {BK_GENDERS_LINK} determine which gender is most adequate to inherit. Most kingdoms adopt Agnatic gender law combined with Primogeniture inheritance, both together meaning 'The firstborn male'." />

While gender laws may heavily favor one gender over the other, they do not exclude either. For example, Agnatic law sets males for precedence. However, if a clan's only remaining member is female, she will inherit the clan regardless." />

	        link_id="BK_KNIGHTS_LINK"
	        text="{=!}Knights are property-owning nobles that fight for their house/clan in military retinues. Although a knight usually does not have any blood ties to their overlord, they are considered part of their Household, and therefore stand as valid candidates to inherit the clan and its properties. The premise of Knighthood is the Knight-Service: knights will submit to you as vassals and obey faithfully, in exchange of a fee. Knighthood is required to raise new military parties, with the exception of your close relatives. The knight's fee is a property, either {BK_ESTATES_LINK} or {BK_LORDSHIPS_LINK}, the {BK_TITLES_LINK} associated with {VILLAGES_LINK}.{newline}{newline}Estate-owning knights will often still need financial aid. Therefore, they will be part of your payroll. However, their estate will pay for part of their expenses.{newline}{newline}Lordship holders instead fully pay for their expenses, and therefore will never be in your payroll. These knights will also administer their village, building constructions. Therefore, you are advised to give them your best, most productive properties, as their income will determine the size and quality of their parties.{newline}{newline}To grant someone knighthood, you need at least the minimum level of {BK_PEERAGE_LINK}, granted to you on joinning a kingdom. Knighthood will require a Fee, estate or lordship, as well as an initial payment and influence. Therefore, choose well who to invest knighthood. It can be granted through dialogue, directly speaking to the knighthood candidate." />

	        link_id="BK_PEERAGE_LINK"
	        text="{=!}Peerage is the concept of one being a Peer of the realm, or in other words, high nobility. Peerage itself can come in different levels, often in the forms of Lesser and Full Peerages, the first awarded on joinning a kingdom, the second won through majority vote or on becoming a ruler. The level of Peerage restricts lords from doing certain things. For example, lesser Peers are not adequate candidates for settlement awards (from conquests). Peerage and its restrictions may be checked in any clan Enclycopedia page. In Banner Kings, the original game clans are Full Peerage clans, while many new, randomly generated clans, {BK_GENTRY_LINK}, only have Lesser Peerage." />

	        link_id="BK_GENTRY_LINK"
	        text="{=!}Gentry clans are the lowest level of clans among the high nobility. These AI clans spawn with Lesser {BK_PEERAGE_LINK}, meaning they do not play big part in the realm's politics and do not receive fiefs from conquests (unless given them directly, which is possible). These clans spawn with {BK_ESTATES_LINK} properties, and live in the villages of their property. Since their income is low, moving around on military retinues would be a major waste (and unrealistic for all lords, anyway). However, they can be summoned to service through the Call Banners decision. Gentry clans also offer many marriage possibilities to low or mid status players, who are often restricted from accession spouses from the major clans, due to {BK_SPOUSE_LINK} differences." />

	<Concept title="{=!}Spouse Score"
	        id="str_bk_spouse"
	        group="Characters"
	        link_id="BK_SPOUSE_LINK"
	        text="{=!}Spouse Score is a concept added by Banner Kings that dramatically alters how marriages function. Marriages among the high nobility are often made out of gain, not love, and are highly hierarchical, as are the societies behind them. As such, clan leaders do not accept marriage offers between spouses that differ too much in social standing, which is represented by the Spouse Score. The score is composed mostly by the clan's social standing - their {BK_TITLES_LINK} and properties -, but also by the spouse's personal merits, by the clan leader's opinion of you, and the relationship between both proposed spouses." />

	<Concept title="{=!}Lordships"
	        id="str_bk_lordships"
	        group="Settlements"
	        link_id="BK_LORDSHIPS_LINK"
	        text="{=!}Lordships are {VILLAGES_LINK} and their associated {BK_TITLES_LINK}. Lordships work differently from other fiefs in one important manner: their de facto ownership and control is context-based. Without Banner Kings, villages are always controlled by the lord of the castle or town the villages are bound to. Through lordships, a village is controlled by the lordship de jure ruler, the legal owner of the title associated with that village. However, this only applies when both the village and the de jure owner share the same realm. Villages still change factions depending on who controls the castle/town. If the de jure owner is not present within the same realm as the village, then the castle/town holder controls the lordship. The de facto controller of the lordship enjoys its full income. Therefore we have that lordships are controlled by:{newline}1. The de jure title holder, if they are present in the same kingdom as the village itself;{newline}2. The castle/town holder, in the absence of a jure owner.{newline}{newline}Because of their nature, lordships allow the existance of {BK_KNIGHTS_LINK}. Knights can hold a lordship on their own, despite not being clan leaders." />

	        text="{=!}Titles describe the legal ownership of a piece of land or region. Titles can be landed - directly correlated to a fief, such as village or castle - or unlanded - dukedoms, kingdoms and empires -, that is, titles that rule over others but are not directly related to an individual fief. Such titles are immutable in everything other than their holders, {BK_DEJURE_LINK} and {BK_DEFACTO_LINK}, which may or may not be the same person. Titles are organized in a hierarchy, and with few exceptions, this hierarchy never changes, and a title certainly never changes in its nature (ie, a village title is always a village title). This hierarchy ranges from {BK_LORDSHIPS_LINK}, attached to villages, going through Baronies (castles), Counties (towns), Dukedoms (presides over multiple counties), Kingdom (presides over multiple dukedoms, represents a faction), all the way to Empires (presides over multiple Kingdoms).{newline}{newline}Title ownership is a major source of social status and relevant across multiple fields in Banner Kings.{newline}{newline}The main way to acquire a title is to Claim it, which takes 1 year, and then Usurp it. This and other title information and actions are all available in the Demesne Hierarchy menu, inside settlements." />

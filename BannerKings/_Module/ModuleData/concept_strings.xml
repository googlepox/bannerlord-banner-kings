Titles are organized in a hierarchy, and with few exceptions, this hierarchy never changes, and a title certainly never changes in its nature (ie, a village title is always a village title). This hierarchy ranges from {BK_LORDSHIPS_LINK}, attached to villages, going through Baronies (castles), Counties (towns), Dukedoms (presides over multiple counties), Kingdom (presides over multiple dukedoms, represents a faction), all the way to Empires (presides over multiple Kingdoms).{newline}{newline}Title ownership is a major source of social status and relevant across multiple fields in Banner Kings.{newline}{newline}The main way to acquire a title is to Claim it, which takes 1 year, and then Usurp it. This and other title information and actions are all available in the Demesne Hierarchy menu, inside settlements." />

	        text="{=!}Demesne or domain describes a piece of land or administration legally bound to a contract. This binding is expressed by {BK_TITLES_LINK}. All demesnes culminate into a Kingdom or Empire level title, which are always associated with {KINGDOMS_LINK}. The entire demesne of a faction may be described as Crown or Royal Demesne. A faction that is not associated with a title may have it's demesne created through the Found Kingdom decision. Landed demesne is any property directly associated with {SETTLEMENTS_LINK}, such as {TOWNS_LINK}. Unlanded demesne is the suzerainship over other, lesser demesnes, such as the legal ownership of a dukedom or kingdom." />

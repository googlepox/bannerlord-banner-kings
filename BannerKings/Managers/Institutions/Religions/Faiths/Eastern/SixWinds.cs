Besides the pantheon of gods, spirits are known to inhabit the natural world, specially mountains, streams and lakes. Such spirits can be benign or otherwise - only through the shamans, the Kams, can the Devseg communicate with and understand them. The Devseg also believe in the Great She-Wolf, who many a great house claims to be their ancestors. Sighting wolves is often considered a good omen, and to be considered a half-wolf is a great honor. Notably tolerant of other faiths, the Six Winds shamans have also incorporated the local Devseg beliefs of Iltanlar, a mountain god of a Devseg tribe that settled on Baltakhand long before the arrival of the hordes.");
